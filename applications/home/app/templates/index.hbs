                 This website shares some observations from a long research into the subject of popular media, mainstream news media, social media platforms, the category of the ‘user’, phantom in that it is behind screens, the political consequences of our current media ecology.

                 Consider a short video in vertical format uploaded onto a platform as the unit
              of mediatic circulation. The moment a video enters the servers of a platform it
              is immediately processed and made computable. Its technical and visual
              properties become available to the machine and algorithm in the following
              ways: frame-by-frame analysis using computer vision algorithms, identifying
              objects, scenes, people in the visual content. Text recognition through OCR,
              audio analysis to detect music and voice, transcribe speech, translate, and
              generate captions on which, Natural Language Processing or NLP produces
              additional context. Information present in the media file, the user uploading it,
              the location, user’s network, history and more - all of this makes this mediatic
              unit computable to the algorithm which gives it a vector — that makes it
              circulate, sends it onto the feeds of other ‘users’ scrolling the platform.
              This is from a machinic point of view.

        Now from the human pov, if we look at the first reel we saw - there is micro-event, then there is a reaction to it, there is music and emoticons - everything one is supposed to feel is pre-resolved. There is no ambiguity. Rections and emotions are chewed up provided.


        <h1>2. Jiska Paisa, Uski Baat </h1>


         A set of 10 or 20
        seemingly unrelated pieces comes together on a feed and produces meaning
        for the human user and data for the machine.

        For the purpose of this investigation, I looked at the event of the Bihar
        Elections, which was running parallel to my residency at Khoj.  Mediatically, Elections are mega events. This gave us a good anchor point to look at these streams of media.
        <br>
        Since 2014, elections are being fought in the digital space. Perception building, PR, misinformation, rumors, gossip, affect, emotion, rift - everything is deployed.

        <h1>3. RECON </h1>

        We built a tool to investigate the mediatic landscape centered around an
        event.

        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/akshay_recon.jpg">

        <br>

        Taking Bihar as a test event, this prototype console aggregates streams and data from various sources - online, local, cable, print, television, social media, ads, PR, meta tools for ads - and allows for an analysis of this information.
        <br><br>
        The techniques we use for sound synthesis - signal processing - are deployed to observe, investigate and study the streams of media that surround us. Further, Grid operates as a forensic instrument that makes visible the structural patterns of narrative manipulation, not just what is being said, but how information architectures are engineered to shape belief.
        <br><br>
        What kinds of tools does the public need to investigate this vectorized media?
        What types of mental models do we need to make sense of this climate?
        How does the body become a public through the machine?
        <br><br>

        A place where I could bring together streams from youtube, Instagram and
        the web at large.
        Political ads from Meta,
        Political ads from google.
        Ads running each day.
        The ad spend on each ad.
        So once we have this - we can begin to look at this data from different disciplinary lenses to deconstruct it. 

        A journalistic investigative tool built by Akshay, my collaborator for this work - is used on the text to analyse narratives.  plot heroes and villains that each unit produces.

        Observations :
        The shift of mainstream news from broadcast to Youtube will have an impact
        on the form further. As of now, news channels are infra-structurally still
        working in the same way - at-least outwardly looking - the sources have ofcourse
        changed - from stringers and local journalists to twitter and WhatsApp.
        The feedback from YouTube live - comments, live views and an insights
        dashboard with demographic information - will transform what these news
        channels are doing and how they are doing it. This is a place for theoretical
        investigation of a shift from broadcast to YouTube.

<h1>4. 'user' is a political category </h1>

<p>

The next observation is about the category of the user - Currently the user
has no rights. The user can only agree to the terms and conditions to
participate in the online life.
The user is forbidden from being political. Various tactics of aesthetic
mediation, shadow banning, warning, intimidation and denial are used.
Looking at the ‘user’ from Marx-ian lens - the category of labor, resource,
product and surplus.
The categories collapse and the user foes the labor, is the resource (in terms
of data) and is also the product. The surplus and the wages - both collapse
into the category of profit.
If I ask Zuck, it is leisure and not labor, the resource is the compute power
and yes - the raw material is the human - the user, the voluntary user.
The citizen, the actor, the mask, the historical body, the consumer, the voter,
the influencer, the hacker, the bureaucrat, the pirate and the coder - the
singular in the public, different from singular in the data. How the production
of desire affects positions and perspectives ?
What tools do we as users need to assert our political rights as users ?
What differentiates the phantom publics of Nepal from the sit in publics of
Occupy movement?
What is it that doesn’t make the user ask for more than the ability to like share
and subscribe?
How is it that the users can identify - isolation, depression, provide new
vocabularies, but not question their positions as users in the isolationist
tech ?
The social media billionaire is an old category - the new category is the ai
billionaire. This points to a future where ai consumes the data produced by
the user and regurgitates it into new configurations of the voice, personae,
body, ‘linguistic thought’ and even a public. The voice without a body, a body
without a voice, and a body with thought. The scope of influence that we as
individuals have on each other is immense. There is an immense potential in
conversation.
What is the scope of phantom conversations ? A phantom public made real
and real made phantom in the image of each other. This has profound
political consequences that are worth considering.
The recent budget was based on the category of the content creator and
influencer. How do we understand this shift from the reason based society to
innovation based society and not to an influencer society?
In a recent talk given by the Chief of Army Staff, General Upendra Dwivedi,
he spoke about narrative management systems and how victory is in the
mind.
In all of this - the person playing the part of the voter, the citizen, the
immigrant, the consumer, the vigilante, the user, the influencer - are all
dynamically chosen. Part of the beauty and hope is that these masks are
flippable — The immigrant becomes the influencer - as with Mamdani. The
citizen influencer becomes a threat to national security - as with Sonam
Wangchuk. RSS member becomes spy becomes hacker becomes solider.
And everyone is skating in the mediatic landscape.
So when the public becomes phantom, the public space has to be exorcised.
It will take an epistemic shift for every one of us to reach a digital ecology that
is public, where we can meet.
The status of the user is as serious as the status of a citizen.
We have migrated from Orkut to Facebook to instagram and now it is a
matter of building consensus about an epistemic shift in what we consider
digital public spaces.
To fellow media artists, technologists and media theorists I would like to say -
We have to seize the means of computation. this is the moment to build the
tools for asserting our rights as users, sitting together and building
frameworks that are computable, that work at the level of neural networks.
We need to break the code and legally challenge the contracts that bind us.
Thank you.

    <h1> 5. Reels, Dreams and the production of desire </h1>

    If in the 70s, broadcast media changed the structure of the domestic space, 50 years later, in the 2020s, social media is changing the structure of democracies/bodies, but also of dreams. What does it mean for us to be living inside technology. Within the hyperobject of code. 

            This work explodes the 'reel' and its relation to dream and the production of desire.
            <br><br>
            The dream is a private experience that recreates social and other realities. This staging and restaging that prepares the mind for the various possibilities of the incoming day now have a private instrument that is present within the same intimate boundary- computing memory, evidence, the power of witnessing, and the weight of agency, sociality, collective memory. 

            <br>
            Voting is also a private act/ like a dream and like viewing a reel. In that does it then also hold the possibility of building a relationship with oneself? 

            Transformation of one human into another as a function of time (through the bhaval case ) and the ability to engage with state, memory history, become truely interdisciplinary through a disciplinary training gave me some fins to enter this inquiry.

            Data as image and data as truth - vs - photograph as evidence. 
    
        The workshop explored voting or polling as a boundary object to think about society. And our relationship to ourself. 
      

        The audition as cross-examination : : Voter as user 

        Polling questions for participants of the workshop.



    <h1> 6. Dreamer, Hacker, Influencer, User, Voter </h1>


        <i>“In philosophical terms, all signals have the same flat ontological importance; what’s important is not what
                they are, but what an operator can do with them.”</i> - Graham Wakefield. “Generating Sound & Organizing
              Time:
              Thinking with gen~ Book 1”


              War rooms -- larps- playing someone else. <br>
              acting -- playing someone else <br>
              <br>
              The persona on the web and its relationship to the self is a site of freedom and imagination. To not frame the question in terms of anonymity on the web as an organizing prinicple, survaillance as the tool of power, and subversions in the ways it has historically happened, there are frameworks waiting to be discovered.

              <br>
               How do we change these masks, understand the protocols of survaillence, and find the means to collectively defy, organize and enjoy our freedoms and disruptions to power that wants to consolidate.



              <br><br>
              Zuleikha Chaudhari’s rehersal of the play 'The Muslim Vanishes' by Syed Naqvi takes place inside a newsroom. Slowly we see the unraveling of the news network in the face of a changing power structure. 

              iconography, color, and sound in the production of state and polity - are the ingredients in the production of the media landscapes.

              The lack of news in the newsroom has another hidden admission. That of an alternate method of communication and organization by the 'avarna' part of the population. 

              This was an interesting proposition for me. 

              There is a live staging of the world we live in -- which was the work of network TV is now happening through social media. 

              The actor and sports stars - celebrities who were the banners of advertising is now migrating to influencer - the job of the influencer to be convincing. For Shahrukh khan's selling of Rajnigandha still needed some suspension of dibelief, now the products are present in worlds that they are part of. And the user has to suspend belief when they enter. We neither completely trust anythign, nor entirely mistrust it. It is also not evidence that is persistant and is usually lost - there is no history to a feed. 

              What is the congruence between a user-bse and an eletorate?

            <h3>g0v</h3>
            <p>
              //demonstrate//
              The g0v movement, or g0v, (pronounced gov-zero /ɡʌvziroʊ/) is an open source, open government
              collaboration
              started by Chia-liang Kao ("clkao"), ipa, kirby and others in late 2012 in Taiwan.
              Originally driven by a bimonthly hackathon, the community has expanded to include different professional
              and non-information technology background members. Symbolizing the community's efforts to "rethink the
              role of
              government from zero," and borrowing the parlance of binary from the digital world of 1s and 0s, the O in
              "gov" is replaced with a 0 to make "g0v"; for many government agencies in Taiwan which have URLs ending
              .gov.tw,
              replacing .gov with .g0v redirects the user to the so-called shadow government, a "forked" version of that
              agency
              with contributions by civic hackers. Continuing this inspiration from the software development world, the
              forked
              content can then be "merged" back into the government agency's website.

              g0v is a community that promotes the transparency of government information and is committed to developing
              information platforms and tools for citizens to participate in society. As of the beginning of 2014, there
              have
              been contributors across three continents, and the results have been released in a free software model
              that
              embraces knowledge sharing.
