        RESEARCH QUESTION

      </h3> --}}
      <p>




        This website documents the year-long research investigating <i>media</i> and the data attached to it. Media in movement as an alive interweave in our social fabric against the backdrop of big tech, war and ai. The methodology is to probe at live media with a tool that also produces media that collides, reflects and intervene in the streams. Media streams by nature are disruptive, so it would be belabouring to say that it is to disrupt.
        What kind of tools are there to excavate / understand / observe and report the nature of this interaction. and collect and create vocabulary for this amorphous idea of 'data' ? It may even be that this interface.

        From the philosophical position of Preciado's pharmacopornographical regime and the production of desire as the primary function of the form of social media regime created by the silicon valley logic, this work explodes the 'reel' and its relation to dream. production of desire, viewing of violence, the desire for violence,
        <br><br>
        This is a phenomenon that is social and carefully present within the boundary of the individual, presented not through public viewing like cinema but the private instrument of the phone.
        <br><br>

        Western artistic eduation and practice - that works with the logics also of individual production, individaula production, and very much present within the political identity of the individual artist. Much of the work that I see - itself is a wrestling with this impossible catagorization. And a clashing of metal that is representation of community, the fear of appropriation and misrepresntation, inability to find home in this entangled histories. Between taking responsibility for historical wrongs and the guilt of privelege - both moving posts - because there is always someone above and someone below, in a failing economy, this psycosis of athoritarian regimes - the inability to position oneself - as a worker or in a collective, the artist is doomed. This is not a poition I could accept and the game of political identites can be broken easily with forms of thinking - not with machine but with minds of the biological kind.
        <br><br>
        Zuleikha’s work of the actor and citizen, transformation of one human into another as a function of time (through the bhaval case ) and the ability to engage with state, memory history, become truely interdisciplinary through a disciplinary training gave me some fins to enter this inquiry.

     If in the 70s, broadcast media changed the structure of the domestic space, 50 years later, in the 2020s, social media is changing the structure of democracies/bodies.
<br><br>
Taking Bihar as a test event, this prototype console aggregates streams and data from various sources - online, local, cable, print, television, social media, ads, PR, meta tools for ads - and allows for an analysis of this information.
<br><br>
The techniques we use for sound synthesis - signal processing - are deployed to observe, investigate and study the streams of media that surround us. Further, Grid operates as a forensic instrument that makes visible the structural patterns of narrative manipulation, not just what is being said, but how information architectures are engineered to shape belief.
<br><br>
What kinds of tools does the public need to investigate this vectorized media?
What types of mental models do we need to make sense of this climate?
How does the body become a public through the machine?

              The same can be said about data. All data has the same flat ontological importance. What’s important is
              what can
              be done with it. I am in search of tools that can sense the digital world, interpret it, and tune it - the
              sickle and hammer of the technological age. Tools that are held by us - not subject to service or
              subscription.
              Simple tools.

              In the pluralistic context of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Japan, Iran - where we live in
              parallel, we
              live multiple lives, in a collective chaos - where the experience is created and consumed at scale and
              complexity - how can we think of society, community, collectivity, government, democracy, and technology?
              Who
              are we as data? And who do we want to be? What agency can we have with our mediatic selves? The power of
              creating experiences and experiencing experiences is not where the buck stops. <b>How does one get power
                to affect
                reality?</b>
              <br>
              <br>
              Authoritarianism emerged from a certain form of social media in the West and India. A different kind of
              participatory democratic model has emerged in Taiwan, and the firewall of China has produced a digital
              border
              concurrent with political borders, within which it has produced its internal logic of self and the
              digital.
              <br>
              <br>
              I propose a collaboration with Akshay Madan, a technologist and an astute observer of the political and
              media
              landscape of India. With Madan, I would like to build on the tool <a
                href="https://article-14.com/"><strong>'Grid'</strong></a>
              (Password : password) to produce an immersive environment (sound, live video
              and data analysis) analysing data and information from Live TV News.
              In its current beta form, Grid detects misinformation and manipulation in news/journalistic text. Grid
              finds
              the heroes and villains in the narrative, revealing propaganda and its tactics. It does so using
              journalistic
              frameworks (please see whitepaper in the drive link above).
              <br>
              <br>
              Using the craft of signal processing (which has been the basis for my sound work over the last decade) and
              Akshay’s knowledge of media, AI, and digital tools, a Live TV News signal is transcribed and fed into
              Grid.
              Grid gives out a minute by minute analysis - which can be plotted in various forms. This is where the
              signal
              processing happens - we encode different parameters to sounds, produce the different markers - to be
              discovered and invented during the residency. Simultaneously, the same news is fed into sentiment analysis
              AI
              models, giving us more granular control over the subjectivities of the narrative.
              <br>
              <br>
              The original purpose of the news is to reach a certain people. We analyse its geographical and linguistic
              spread map and produce a new signal/news which contains differently paced information that reveals the
              real
              structures of power and capital.
              <br>
              <br>
              Khoj would become the ‘live control room’ - where a signal is observed, processed, and a new signal
              produced
              and perhaps even distributed.

        Piyush Kashyap or <a href="https://zeropowercut.work/jangayek"> <strong>Zeropowercut </strong></a> has been
        working with jangayak Raju Ranjan for some time. We met Raju to discuss

        disinformation. On our way to Aarah to meet Raju, we met different people on the local train. The bustle of the
        train was filled with soundtracks of reels - quick and shifting, from music to speech, bhojpuri, hindi, rallies,
        songs, reporters, political ads and so on.

          The idea of this workshop is to develop conceptual and practical tools for artists and others interested in
          working with both large and small datasets. Through methods of collective thinking and role-based exercises,
          we
          will play out a high-stakes techno-political scenario from multiple perspectives—algorithmic, institutional,
          ecological, and embodied. The workshop will encourage participants to examine data at multiple
          scales—microscopic and
          telescopic—and across different temporalities. Together, we will explore how art practices can intervene in,
          visualize, or reimagine the structures and implications of data systems.
          <br>
          <br>
          The main-takeaways of the workshop will be -
          The hands-on experience of using open source data tools as easily as we use google docs or excel sheets as
          ways
          of listening to data.
          Ways of collective thinking like LARPs, and war rooms that allow us to take positions different from ourselves
          and to actively respond to propositions and hypothetical situations.
          Using the case study of Taiwan and its g0v movements, and looking at a different logic to a tech-enabled
          democracy.

              The g0v movement, or g0v, (pronounced gov-zero /ɡʌvziroʊ/) is an open source, open government
              collaboration
              started by Chia-liang Kao ("clkao"), ipa, kirby and others in late 2012 in Taiwan.
              Originally driven by a bimonthly hackathon, the community has expanded to include different professional
              and non-information technology background members. Symbolizing the community's efforts to "rethink the
              role of
              government from zero," and borrowing the parlance of binary from the digital world of 1s and 0s, the O in
              "gov" is replaced with a 0 to make "g0v"; for many government agencies in Taiwan which have URLs ending
              .gov.tw,
              replacing .gov with .g0v redirects the user to the so-called shadow government, a "forked" version of that
              agency
              with contributions by civic hackers. Continuing this inspiration from the software development world, the
